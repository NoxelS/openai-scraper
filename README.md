# TypeScript Puppeteer Web Scraper Template

This is a template repository for building a web scraper using TypeScript and Puppeteer. With this template, you can quickly set up a project structure that includes TypeScript support and Puppeteer dependencies.
## Getting Started

To use this template, you can simply click the "Use this template" button on GitHub, or fork the repository to your own account.

Once you have the repository on your local machine, you can install the dependencies using Yarn or npm:

```sh
yarn install
# or
npm install
```
To compile the scraper, you can use the start command:

```sh
npm run compile
# or
npm run dev-compile
```
To run the scraper, you can use the start command:

```sh
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

This will run the scraper.ts file, which contains the basic code to launch a headless browser and navigate to a web page. You can modify this file to add your own scraping logic.

## TypeScript Support

This template includes TypeScript support out of the box. You can write your scraping code in TypeScript and run it using the ts-node package.
## Puppeteer

This template includes the Puppeteer package, which provides a high-level API for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium. You can use Puppeteer to navigate web pages, interact with DOM elements, and extract data.
